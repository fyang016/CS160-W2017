1. A basic program calculating Pi is given in the slides. Please check it. If changes are needed, note that "static long num_steps=100000", (the number of steps of the for loop) should NOT be changed. 

2. The program matmul.c is provided. Please only modify the part I enclosed with strings like "//////////////////" (line 39-53). Do not change any other parts. 

3. Please submit 3 programs (source code files) for the first 3 problems, which should be named as FIRSTNAME_LASTNAME01, FIRSTNAME_LASTNAME02 and FIRSTNAME_LASTNAME03 respectively. 

4. Please also submit a separate pdf file (REPORT) that answers ALL of the QUESTIONS. It should be named as FIRSTNAME_LASTNAME.pdf.  For the first 2 questions, please paste the complete source code in this documentation file. For the 3rd question, please paste only the code where you parallelize with OpenMP, i.e. line 39-53 in the file matmul.c. For all these 3 programs, please respectively run your parallel version with 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8 threads. Report the time cost for each run in this documentation file. For the first 2 programs, please also report the value of PI for each run.
